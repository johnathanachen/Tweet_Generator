  president trump proclaims today as     republicans senators are working hard to pass the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country the bill is getting better and better this is a once in a generation chance obstructionist dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit the jury was not told the killer of kate was a 7 time felon the schumer/pelosi democrats are so weak on crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice build the wall a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration the christmas story begins 2000 years ago with a mother a father their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all—the gift of god’s love for all of humanity

whatever our beliefs we know that the birth of jesus christ and the story of his life today is a day that i’ve been looking very much forward to all year long it is one that you have heard me speak about many times before

during the crown prince’s visit he is advancing  billion in commercial deals including finalizing the purchase of f-16’s thank you  let’s continue making america great again   the dow just broke 24000 for the first time another all-time record if the dems had won the presidential election the market would be down 50% from these levels and consumer confidence which is also at an all-time high would be “low and glum” stock market hits new record high confidence and enthusiasm abound more great numbers coming out the chinese envoy who just returned from north korea seems to have had no impact on little rocket man hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions russia and china condemned the launch the failing  has totally gone against the social media guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went rogue   the failing  the pipe organ for the democrat party has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive tax cut bill they are wrong so often that now i know we have a winner funny to hear the democrats talking about the national debt when president obama doubled it in only 8 years “had the information crooked hillary’s emails been released there would have been harm to national security"
charles mccullough
fmr intel comm inspector general the only people who don’t like the tax cut bill are the people that don’t understand it or the obstructionist democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the republicans the house of representatives seeks contempt citations against the justicedepartment and the fbi for withholding key documents and an fbi witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of donald trump big stuff deep state give this information now   don’t focus on me focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom we are doing just fine now we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore american prosperity – and reclaim america’s destiny

but in order to achieve this bright and glowing future the senate must pass tax cuts – and bring main street roaring back to life
 … a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put america first it is time to take care of our workers to protect our communities and to rebuild our great country   this week the senate can join the house & take a strong stand for the middle class families who are the backbone of america together we will give the american people a big beautiful christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets americans keep more of their hard-earned money departing  for st charles missouri to help push our plan for historic tax cuts across the finish line

a successful vote in the senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the american people
