a must watch  legal scholar Alan dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest witch hunt in us political history enjoy

with the great vote on cutting taxes this could be a big day for the stock market - and you

putting pelosi/schumer liberal puppet jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great republican agenda of low on taxes tough on crime strong on military and borders& so much more look at your 401-k’s since election highest stock market ever jobs are roaring back

democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in Alabama we need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration border wall military pro life va judges 2nd amendment and more no to jones a pelosi/schumer puppet

report  “anti-Trump FBI agent led Clinton email probe”  now it all starts to make sense

people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of Brian ross of @abc news he has been suspended should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars

after years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation and more running the FBI its reputation is in tatters - worst in history but fear not we will bring it back to greatness

tainted no very dishonest FBI “agent’s role in Clinton probe under review” led Clinton email probe @foxandfriends  Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge

such a total miscarriage of justice in San Francisco

1 enter country illegally
2 fire a stolen sig sauer handgun into a group of people
3 sever the aorta of a young woman & kill her
4 throw gun in sf bay…

wray needs to clean house now we know the politicization even worse than mccabe's ties to mcauliffe/Clinton it also infected his top investigator peter strzok who sent texts bashing Trump & praising Hillary during campaign strzok led Hillary probe & supervised Trump probe

maybe now the media will pay attention to the scandal uncovered by @judicialwatch engulfing Andrew mccabe the #2 official at the @FBI  @realDonaldTrump needs to clean house at FBI/doj  …

breaking  top FBI investigator for mueller peter strzok busted sending political text messages bashing Trump & praising Hillary during the 2016 campaign strzok actually led the Hillary email probe & recommended clearing her; then was tapped to supervise the Trump Russia probe

@potus has done more to combat the addiction crisis than any other president

the Trump effect  “the us economy is running at its full potential for the first time in a decade” -WSJ

i never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn just more fake news covering another Comey lie

congratulations to @abc news for suspending Brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia witch hunt more networks and “papers” should do the same with their fake news

many people in our country are asking what the “justice” department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked Hillary after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress deleted and “acid washed” 33000 emails no justice

so general Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording lies many timesand nothing happens to her rigged system or just a double standard

great job first lady Melania

thank you to the talented performers from vivid ballet company who helped us unveil this year's decorations at the @whitehouse

62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in montgomery Alabama uttered one word that changed history

i had to fire general Flynn because he lied to the vice president and the FBI he has pled guilty to those lies it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful there was nothing to hide

biggest tax bill and tax cuts in history just passed in the senate now these great republicans will be going for final passage thank you to house and senate republicans for your hard work and commitment

we are one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families across America special thanks to @senatemajldr Mitch Mcconnell and chairman @senorrinhatch for shepherding our bill through the senate look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas

economists on the tax cuts and jobs act

“the enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations”

the media has been speculating that I fired rex tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - fake news he’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects I call the final shots we work well together and America is highly respected again


president Trump proclaims today as #worldaidsday

republicans senators are working hard to pass the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country the bill is getting better and better this is a once in a generation chance obstructionist dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit

the jury was not told the killer of kate was a 7 time felon the schumer/pelosi democrats are so weak on crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections

the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice build the wall

a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration

the Christmas story begins 2000 years ago with a mother a father their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all—the gift of god’s love for all of humanity

whatever our beliefs we know that the birth of jesus christ and the story of his life

today is a day that i’ve been looking very much forward to all year long it is one that you have heard me speak about many times before

now as president of the united states it is my tremendous honor to finally wish America and the world a very merry Christmas

today it was my great honor to meet with the crown prince of bahrain at the @whitehouse bahrain and the united states are important partners

during the crown prince’s visit he is advancing $9 billion in commercial deals including finalizing the purchase of f-16’s

thank you @senorrinhatch let’s continue making America great again

the dow just broke 24000 for the first time another all-time record if the dems had won the presidential election the market would be down 50% from these levels and consumer confidence which is also at an all-time high would be “low and glum”

stock market hits new record high confidence and enthusiasm abound more great numbers coming out

the chinese envoy who just returned from north Korea seems to have had no impact on little rocket man hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions Russia and china condemned the launch

the failing @nytimes has totally gone against the social media guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went rogue  @foxandfriends

the failing @nytimes the pipe organ for the democrat party has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive tax cut bill they are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner

funny to hear the democrats talking about the national debt when president Obama doubled it in only 8 years

“had the information crooked Hillary’s emails been released there would have been harm to national security"
charles mccullough
fmr intel comm inspector general

the only people who don’t like the tax cut bill are the people that don’t understand it or the obstructionist democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the republicans

the house of representatives seeks contempt citations against the justicedepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump big stuff deep state give this information now @foxnews

@theresa_may don’t focus on me focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom we are doing just fine

now we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore American prosperity – and reclaim America’s destiny

but in order to achieve this bright and glowing future the senate must pass tax cuts – and bring main street roaring back to life
 …

a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first it is time to take care of our workers to protect our communities and to rebuild our great country

this week the senate can join the house & take a strong stand for the middle class families who are the backbone of America together we will give the American people a big beautiful Christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets Americans keep more of their hard-earned money

departing @jba_nafw for st charles missouri to help push our plan for historic tax cuts across the finish line

a successful vote in the senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the American people


economy growing excluding hurricane effects cea estimates that real GDP growth would have been 39% in q3

stock market at a new high unemployment at a low we are winning and tax cuts will shift our economy into high gear

just spoke to president xi jinping of china concerning the provocative actions of north Korea additional major sanctions will be imposed on north Korea today this situation will be handled

so now that matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in Florida years ago investigate

wow matt lauer was just fired from nbc for “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace” but when will the top executives at nbc & comcast be fired for putting out so much fake news check out andy lack’s past

looks like another great day for the stock market consumer confidence is at record high I guess somebody likes me my policies

great and we should boycott fake news CNN dealing with them is a total waste of time

Christmas comes early finally good news from @CNN   …

new home sales reach a 10 year high stock market has more record gains hopefully republican senators will give us the much needed tax cuts to keep it all going democrats want big tax increases

the tax cut bill is coming along very well great support with just a few changes some mathematical the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings and the pass through provision becomes simpler and really works well

the good news is that their ratings are terrible nobody cares

fake news  morning joe scarborough @joenbc caught pretending pre-taped day after thanksgiving show was live  …

we should have a contest as to which of the networks plus CNN and not including fox is the most dishonest corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president me they are all bad winner to receive the fake news trophy

back in dc big week for tax cuts and many other things of great importance to our country  senate republicans will hopefully come through for all of us the tax cut bill is getting better and better the end result will be great for all

since the first day I took office all you hear is the phony democrat excuse for losing the election Russia RussiaRussia  despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month president make America great again

i endorsed luther strange in the Alabama primary he shot way up in the polls but it wasn’t enough can’t let schumer/pelosi win this race liberal jones would be bad

the last thing we need in Alabama and the us senate is a schumer/pelosi puppet who is weak on crime weak on the border bad for our military and our great vets bad for our 2nd amendment and wants to raises taxes to the sky jones would be a disaster

wow even I didn’t realize we did so much wish the fake news would report thank you

@foxnews is much more important in the united states than CNN but outside of the us CNN international is still a major source of fake news and they represent our nation to the world very poorly the outside world does not see the truth from them

check out the recent editorial in the wall street journal @WSJ about what a complete disaster the @cfpb has been under its leader from previous administration who just quit

the consumer financial protection bureau or cfpb has been a total disaster as run by the previous administrations pick financial institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public we will bring it back to life

“far right” you mean “right so far” as in @realDonaldTrump has been right so far abt how to kick the economy into high gear

charles manson wasn't the inevitable outgrowth of the sixties if anything he was a harbinger of today's far right

the ungratefulness is something i’ve never seen before if you get someone’s son out of prison he should be grateful to you period I don’t care if Hillary got my kid out of prison as much as I hate the woman i’d thank her corrupt ass

the NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the locker room during the national anthem next season that’s almost as bad as kneeling when will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart this issue is killing your league

lavar you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during thanksgiving with your son in china but no nba contract to support you but remember lavar shoplifting is not a little thing it’s a really big deal especially in china ungrateful fool

it wasn’t the white house it wasn’t the state department it wasn’t father lavar’s so-called people on the ground in china that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - it was me too bad lavar is just a poor man’s version of don king but without the hair just think

big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of elephants or any other animal

shoplifting is a very big deal in china as it should be 5-10 years in jail but not to father lavar should have gotten his son out during my next trip to china instead china told them why they were released very ungrateful

sen jeff flakey who is unelectable in the great state of arizona quit race anemic polls was caught purposely on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite president he’ll be a no on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast”

now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail lavar ball the father of liangelo is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal I should have left them in jail

thank you @realDonaldTrump - this is important to so many of us

the failing @nytimes hates the fact that I have developed a great relationship with world leaders like xi jinping president of china

does the fake news media remember when crooked Hillary Clinton as secretary of state was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button Obama tried also but he had zero chemistry with putin

anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the us should look to our pastand you will doubt it no longer

the north Korean regime has pursued its nuclear & ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance agreement & commmitment it has made to the us and its allies it's broken all of those commitments

the us under my administration is completely rebuilding its military and they're spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world being built right now I want peace through strength

the decision on sergeant bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our country and to our military

jobs jobs jobs

the rigged dem primary one of the biggest political stories in years got zero coverage on fake news network tv last night disgraceful

just took off for ceremony @ pearl harbor will then be heading to japan sKorea china vietnam & the philippines will never let you down

i always felt I would be running and winning against bernie sanders not crooked h without cheating I was right

bernie sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the dem primary by crooked Hillary

based on that the military has hit isis "much harder" over the last two days they will pay a big price for every attack on us

isis just claimed the degenerate animal who killed and so badly wounded the wonderful people on the west side was "their soldier"

pocahontas just stated that the democrats lead by the legendary crooked Hillary Clinton rigged the primaries lets go FBI & justice dept

the real story on collusion is in donna b's new book crooked Hillary bought the dnc & then stole the democratic primary from crazy bernie

people are angry  at some point the justice department and the FBI must do what is right and proper the American public deserves it

new donna b book says she paid for and stole the dem primary what about the deleted e-mails uranium podesta the server plus plus

everybody is asking why the justice department and FBI isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with crooked Hillary & the dems

my twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact

i will be interviewed by @ingrahamangle on @foxnews at 10 00 enjoy

the @tuckercarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great FBI was so sad to watch james Comey's leadership was a disaster

this is real collusion and dishonesty major violation of campaign finance laws and money laundering - where is our justice department

donna brazile just stated the dnc rigged the system to illegally steal the primary from bernie sanders bought and paid for by crooked h

great tax cut rollout today the lobbyists are storming capital hill but the republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America

today it was my pleasure and great honor to announce my nomination of jerome powell to be the next chairman of the @federalreserve

congress must end chain migration so that we can have a system that is security based we need to make America safe #usa

i am calling on congress to terminate the diversity visa lottery program that presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security

congratulations to the houston @astros 2017 #worldseries champions#houstonstrong #earnhistory

there is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed should move fast death penalty

would love to send the nyc terrorist to guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system

nyc terrorist was happy as he asked to hang isis flag in his hospital room he killed 8 people badly injured 12 should get death penalty

great mtg w/ @cabinet today tomorrow I will be announcing the new head of the fed I think you will be extremely impressed by this person

happy birthday to @garyplayer a truly great champion and person

the united states will be immediately implementing much tougher extreme vetting procedures the safety of our citizens comes first

just spoke to president macri of argentina about the five proud and wonderful men killed in the west side terror attack god be with them

chain migration must end now some people come in and they bring their whole family with them who can be truly evil not acceptable

and appeals court judges at a record clip our courts are rapidly changing for the better

thanks to @senatemajldr Mcconnell and the @senategop we are appointing high-quality federal district

thank you to the great nypd first responders and all govt officials for having handled the terrible west side attack so professionally

fully supports any and all of their efforts with respect to the west side attack #nycstrong

just spoke with @nygovcuomo and @nycmayor de blasio to let them know that the federal government

we mourn the horrifying terrorist attack in nyc all of America is praying and grieving for the families who lost their precious loved ones

for the middle class the house and senate should consider asap as the process of final approval moves along push biggest tax cuts ever

wouldn't it be great to repeal the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate in Obamacare and use those savings for further tax cuts

#nycstrong #usa

"senator chuck schumer helping to import europes problems" said coltony shaffer we will stop this craziness  @foxandfriends

we are fighting hard for merit based immigration no more democrat lottery systems we must get much tougher and smarter  @foxandfriends

the terrorist came into our country through what is called the "diversity visa lottery program" a chuck schumer beauty I want merit based

i have just ordered homeland security to step up our already extreme vetting program being politically correct is fine but not for this

the republican house members are working hard and late toward the massive tax cuts that they know you deserve these will be biggest ever

my thoughts condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the new york city terrorist attack god and your country are with you

we must not allow isis to return or enter our country after defeating them in the middle east and elsewhere enough

in nyc looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person law enforcement is following this closely not in the usa

“statement by president Trump on the apprehension of mustafa al-imam for his alleged role in benghazi attacks”

earth shattering he and his brother could drain the swamp which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled fake news weak

the biggest story yesterday the one that has the dems in a dither is podesta running from his firm what he know about crooked dems is

i hope people will start to focus on our massive tax cuts for business jobs and the middle class in addition to democrat corruption

came to the campaign few people knew the young low level volunteer named george who has already proven to be a liar check the dems

the fake news is working overtime as paul manaforts lawyer said there was "no collusion" and events mentioned took place long before he

also there is no collusion

sorry but this is years ago before paul manafort was part of the Trump campaign but why aren't crooked Hillary & the dems the focus

great job by michaelcaputo on @foxandfriends

report out that Obama campaign paid $972000 to fusion gps the firm also got $12400000 really from dnc nobody knows who ok'd

all of this "Russia" talk right when the republicans are making their big push for historic tax cuts & reform is this coincidental not

are now fighting back like never before there is so much guilt by democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out do something

"collusion" which doesn't exist the dems are using this terrible and bad for our country witch hunt for evil politics but the r's

the uranium to Russia deal the  33000 plus deleted emails the Comey fix and so much more instead they look at phony Trump/Russia

never seen such republican anger & unity as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made fake dossier now $12000000

as usual the Obamacare premiums will be up the dems own it but we will repeal & replace and have great healthcare soon after tax cuts

jfk files are released long ahead of schedule

hence I would fully expect corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda didn't have the guts to run

my endorsement he also wanted to be secretary of state I said "no thanks" he is also largely responsible for the horrendous iran deal

senator bob corker "begged" me to endorse him for re-election in tennessee I said "no" and he dropped out said he could not win without

#lasvegasstrong #usa


more and more people are suggesting that republicans and me should be given equal time on tv when you look at the one-sided coverage

@nbcnews is so knowingly inaccurate with their reporting the good news is that the people get it which is really all that matters not #1

i called chuck schumer yesterday to see if the dems want to do a great healthcare bill Obamacare is badly broken big premiums who knows

late night host are dealing with the democrats for their very "unfunny" & repetitive material always anti-Trump should we get equal time

contributions the rnc is taking in far more $'s than the dems and much of it by my wonderful small donors I am working hard for them

can't believe I finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost it discusses the enthusiasm of "Trump" voters through campaign

#stockalert  us markets since the election

@potus @realDonaldTrump in the oval office w/senior us military leaders prior to dinner hosted by the president & first lady @whitehouse

ralph northamwho is running for governor of virginiais fighting for the violent ms-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities  vote ed gillespie

rex tillerson never threatened to resign this is fake news put out by @nbcnews low news and reporting standards no verification from me

stock market hits an all-time high unemployment lowest in 16 years business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades

why isn't the senate intel committee looking into the fake news networks in our country to see why so much of our news is just made up-fake

thank you

god bless president Trump his family and his team who are faithfully and diligently “ making America great again

so wonderful to be in las vegas yesterday and meet with people from police to doctors to the victims themselves who I will never forget

pres Trump  "we cannot be defined by the evil that threatens us or the violence that incites such terror"

we love you las vegas

i will be landing in las vegas shortly to pay my respects with @flotus Melania everyone remains in our thoughts and prayers

the @nbcnews story has just been totally refuted by sec tillerson and @vp pence it is #fakenews they should issue an apology to America

nbc news is #fakenews and more dishonest than even CNN they are a disgrace to good reporting no wonder their news ratings are way down

wow so many fake news stories today no matter what I do or say they will not write or speak truth the fake news media is out of control

a great day in puerto rico yesterday while some of the news coverage is fake most showed great warmth and friendship

my administration will continue to work around the clock with governor @ricardorossello & his team great progress being made #prstrong

@potus and @flotus meet w/ some of America's finest on the uss kearsarge off the coast of pr

tonight the truth about how despicable the media and the left are in America today we will name names 9 est hannity fox news from vegas

3/4  this administration is deeply committed to those who serve & their families who make it possible through their love and support

fnc dominated ratings last night msnbc-disaster demonstrating folks don't trust the network   tonight-vegas analysis

thank you @realDonaldTrump for all the help you are providing for puerto rico we’re are grateful and happy to welcome you and @flotus to

it is a "miracle" how fast the las vegas metropolitan police were able to find the demented shooter and stop him from even more killing

so proud of @fema military and first responders thank you

great meeting with governor mapp of the #usvi he is very thankful for the great job done by @fema and first responders

leaving puerto rico now for dc will be in las vegas early tomorrow to pay my respects everyone is in my thoughts and prayers

save your energy rex we'll do what has to be done

i told rex tillerson our wonderful secretary of state that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with little rocket man

for safety thank you to the governor of pr and to all of those who are working so closely with our first responders fantastic job

people are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by fema and our great military all buildings now inspected

we have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in puerto rico outside of the fake news or politically motivated ingrates

when you kneel for our #nationAlanthem you aren't protesting a specific issue you are protesting our nation and everything it stands for

19000 respecting our national anthem #standforouranthem

in analyzing the Alabama primary racefake news always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up many points after endorsement

because of #fakenews my people are not getting the credit they deserve for doing a great job as seen here they are all doing a great job

very important that NFL players stand tomorrow and always for the playing of our national anthem respect our flag and our country

i will be in pr on tues to further ensure we continue doing everything possible to assist & support the people in their time of great need

results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by san juan mayor doing everything we can to help great people of pr

we must all be united in offering assistance to everyone suffering in puerto rico and elsewhere in the wake of this terrible disaster

#fakenews critics are working overtime but we're getting great marks from the people that truly matter
#prstrong

my administration governor @ricardorossello and many others are working together to help the people of puerto rico in every way

to the people of puerto rico
do not believe the #fakenews
#prstrong

congresswoman jennifer gonzalez-colon of puerto rico has been wonderful to deal with and a great representative of the people thank you

just spoke to governor kenneth mapp of the us virgin islands who stated that #fema and military are doing a great job thank you governor

the governor of puerto rico ricardo rossello is a great guy and leader who is really working hard thank you ricky

despite the fake news media in conjunction with the dems an amazing job is being done in puerto rico great people

the fake news networks are working overtime in puerto rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first r's shame

i will be going to puerto rico on tuesday with Melania will hopefully be able to stop at the us virgin islands people working hard

fake news CNN and nbc are going out of their way to disparage our great first responders as a way to "get Trump" not fair to fr or effort

thank you to all who participated in today's discussion on opioid abuse by talking about it we can start to make a real difference

video  elements of the #dod and @fema are providing humanitarian relief for #puertorico   and #usvi

the military and first responders despite no electric roads phones etc have done an amazing job puerto rico was totally destroyed

want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort 10000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job

such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan and others in puerto rico who are not able to get their workers to help they

thank you to fema our great military & all first responders who are working so hardagainst terrible oddsin puerto rico see you tuesday

the fact is that puerto rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding

puerto rico governor ricardo rossello just stated  "the administration and the president every time we've spoken they've delivered

GDP was revised upward to 31 for last quarter many people thought it would be years before that happened we have just begun

the Trump inaugural committee is donating $3 million in surplus funds to victims of the latest hurricanes

puerto rico is devastated phone system electric grid many roads gone fema and first responders are amazing governor said "great job"

hannity crushing msnbc at 9 good for him check the no spin news on   killing england a huge bestseller - thank you

really hard to help but many have lost their homes military is now on site and I will be there tuesday wish press would treat fairly

fema & first responders are doing a great job in puerto rico massive food & water delivered docks & electric grid dead locals trying

welcome back @stevescalise
#teamscalise

the electric power grid in puerto rico is totally shot large numbers of generators are now on island food and water on site

democrats don't want massive tax cuts - how does that win elections great reviews for tax cut and reform bill

it is time to take care of our people to rebuild our nation and to fight for our great American workers #taxreform #usa

this is the right tax cut @ the right time we will all succeed & grow together – as one team one people & one American family #taxreform

just arrived in Indianapolis Indiana to make an announcement on #taxreform together we are going to make America great again

but the people were pro-Trump virtually no president has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring

facebook was always anti-Trumpthe networks were always anti-Trump hencefake news @nytimesapologized & @wapo were anti-Trump collusion

we will have the votes for healthcare but not for the reconciliation deadline of Friday after which we need 60 get rid of filibuster rule

with one yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from alaska and two others mccain is out we have the hcare vote but not for Friday

spoke to jerry jones of the dallas cowboys yesterday jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done players will stand for country

spoke to roy moore of Alabama last night for the first time sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race he will help to #maga

congratulations to roy moore on his republican primary win in Alabama luther strange started way back & ran a good race roy win in dec

even usain bolt from jamaica one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time showed respect for our national anthem

70 years ago today the national security council met for the first time great history of advising presidents-then & now thanks nsc staff

thank you to our wonderful team @usun and their families keep up the great work #usa

it was an honor to welcome president @marianorajoy of spain thank you for standing w/ us in our efforts to isolate the brutal #noko regime

i want to express our support and extend our prayers to all those affected by the vile terror attack in spain last month

America's hearts & prayers are with the people of #puertorico & the #usvi we will get through this - and we will get through this together

heading over to the @un to meet with ambassador @nikkihaley and all of her great representatives #usa

briefed @potus @realDonaldTrump in #situationroom and thanked him for his leadership quick response & commitment to our people

honored to welcome republican and democrat members of the house ways and means committee to the white house today #usa

the NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations the only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our national anthem

thank you to carmen yulin cruz the mayor of san juan for your kind words on fema etcwe are working hard much food and water there/on way

great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of otto warmbier  1994 - 2017 otto was tortured beyond belief by north Korea

but while dallas dropped to its knees as a team they all stood up for our national anthem big progress being made-we all love our country

the booing at the NFL football game last night when the entire dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest I have ever heard great anger

ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected

a few of the many clips of john mccain talking about repealing & replacing o'care my oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk

owed to wall street and the banks which sadly must be dealt with food water and medical are top priorities - and doing well #fema

it's old electrical grid which was in terrible shape was devastated much of the island was destroyed with billions of dollars

texas & Florida are doing great but puerto rico which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt is in deep trouble

tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our country
#standforouranthem

general john kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our flag or great country

@CNN is #fakenews just reported cos john kelly was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting flag anthem country total lie

NFLplayer pattillman joined us army in 2002 he was killed in action 2004 he fought 4our country/freedom #standforouranthem #boycottNFL

#standforouranthem

the white house never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night important meetings taking place today big tax cuts & reform

the issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race it is about respect for our country flag and national anthem NFL must respect this

many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday which was a small percentage of total these are fans who demand respect for our flag

so proud of nascar and its supporters and fans they won't put up with disrespecting our country or our flag - they said it loud and clear

making America safe is my number one priority we will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet

sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their country NFL should change policy

alaska arizona maine and kentucky are big winners in the healthcare proposal 7 years of repeal & replace and some senators not there

courageous patriots have fought and died for our great American flag  - we must honor and respect it  make America great again

i wonder what this brave American would give to stand on his own two legs just once more for our #anthem

#maga #NFL

you can boycott our anthem

we can boycott you

#NFL #maga

please to inform that the champion pittsburgh penguins of the nhl will be joining me at the white house for ceremony great team

great solidarity for our national anthem and for our country standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable bad ratings

NFL attendance and ratings are way down boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country league should back us

if NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our flag & country you will see change take place fast fire or suspend

just heard foreign minister of north Korea speak at un if he echoes thoughts of little rocket man they won't be around much longer

roger goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our countrytell them to stand

democrats are laughingly saying that mccain had a "moment of courage" tell that to the people of arizona who were deceived 116% increase

iran just test-fired a ballistic missile capable of reaching Israelthey are also working with north Koreanot much of an agreement we have

very proud of our incredible first lady @flotus she is a truly great representative for our country

our great American flag or country and should stand for the national anthem if not you're fired find something else to do

if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFLor other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect

going to the white house is considered a great honor for a championship teamstephen curry is hesitatingtherefore invitation is withdrawn

it was great being with luther strange last night in Alabama what great people what a crowd vote luther on tuesday

alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under Obamacare worst in the country deductibles high people angry lisa m comes through

i know rand paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the party

large block grants to states is a good thing to do better control &  management great for arizona mccain let his best friend lg down

arizona had a 116% increase in Obamacare premiums last year with deductibles very high chuck schumer sold john mccain a bill of goods sad

john mccain never had any intention of voting for this bill which his governor loves he campaigned on repeal & replace let arizona down

heading to Alabama now big crowd

thank you to doug parker and American airlines for all of the help you have given to the us with hurricane flights fantastic job

#usaatunga#unga

will be in Alabama tonight luther strange has gained mightily since my endorsement but will be very close he loves Alabama and so do i

the greatest iNFLuence over our election was the fake news media "screaming" for crooked Hillary Clinton next she was a bad candidate

the Russia hoax continues now it's ads on facebook what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked Hillary

@potus #Trump & @flotus

when all seemed hopelessyou brought hope

you inspire us all

#maga #harvey @scavino45 #usa #texasstrong

these are the 10 most tweeted about world leaders during the first day of #unga general debate

thank you

president Trump's speech at the un was the best speech I have ever heard a sitting us president make in my lifetime

kim jong un of north Korea who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people will be tested like never before

rand paul or whoever votes against hcare bill will forever future political campaigns be known as "the republican who saved Obamacare"

a big day for the us at the united nations

senator luther strange has gone up a lot in the polls since I endorsed him a month ago now a close runoff he will be great in dc

today I announced a new executive order with re  to north Korea we must all do our part to ensure the complete denuclearization of #noko

senator doctor bill cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their healthcare he doesn't lie-just wants to help people

the nra strongly endorses luther strange for senator of Alabamathat means all gun owners should vote for big luther he won't let you down

i would not sign graham-cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions it does a great bill repeal & replace

Alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like "big" luther strange smart tough on crime borders & trade loves vets & military tuesday

on behalf of all Americans I want to wish jewish families many blessings in the new year

went to the senate today to say @potus & I fully support graham-cassidy plan to repeal/replace Obamacare let's get this done

it was a great honor to be with king abdullah ii of jordan and his delegation this morning we had a great bilateral meeting

looking forward to Friday night in the great state of Alabama I am supporting "big" luther strange because he was so loyal & helpful to me

i hope republican senators will vote for graham-cassidy and fulfill their promise to repeal & replace Obamacare money direct to states

rand paul is a friend of mine but he is such a negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare graham-cassidy bill is great ends ocare

join me in praying for @potus he reminded the world “if the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph”

thank you  @foxandfriends - great show

it is the height of hypocrisy Obama and Clinton in effect gave nuclear weapons to north Korea by their policy of appeasement

the world is noticing thanks

Trump is a winner no matter what the haters say he’s actually making this country great again thank you mr president for actually caring

thank you @potus for believing in us like we believed in you #maga

spoke to president of mexico to give condolences on terrible earthquake unable to reach for 3 days b/c of his cell phone reception at site

just left Florida for dc the people and spirit in that great state is unbelievable damage horrific but will be better than ever

am leaving now for Florida to see our great first responders and to thank the us coast guard fema etc a real disaster much work to do

they have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age plus big border security

does anybody really want to throw out good educated and accomplished young people who have jobs some serving in the military really

the wall which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls will continue to be built

no deal was made last night on daca massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent would be subject to vote

the "deplorables" came back to haunt Hillarythey expressed their feelings loud and clear she spent big money but in the end had no game

crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody and every thing but herself for her election loss she lost the debates and lost her direction

china has a business tax rate of 15% we should do everything possible to match them in order to win with our economy jobs and wages

with irma and harvey devastation tax cuts and tax reform is needed more than ever before go congress go
